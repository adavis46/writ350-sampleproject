Anticipated Concerns
Missed deadlines 
Scheduling conflicts 
Finding relevant information 

Conflict Resolution 
If someone isn’t pulling their weight or are being uncooperative, call them out.
If you don’t feel comfortable confronting a team member contact the Project Manager. 
If we can’t resolve a conflict each side will present their case and the Project Manager will have the final say. 

Efficiency
Make sure everyone does their fair share of work and it all comes together smoothly.
If you’re confused or need clarification on your project ask one of your team members.
Don’t procrastinate.

Missed Deadlines 
If you miss a deadline, I or whoever else will remind you that your part is late and you should get it back to us within 24 hours.  
If your portion is not sent within 24 hours, the project manager will contact Mr. Davis.

Unacceptable Work
If someone’s work is below standard they will have to re-do it. 
If you believe a team member’s work is subpar report it to your Project Manager.
If you have questions, always ask; don't spend time doing work that wrong.
No one is responsible for fixing your work, but we’ll help any way possible.
